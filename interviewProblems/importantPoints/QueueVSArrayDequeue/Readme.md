1)ArrayDeque -since internal datastructure is array lookup willbe fast.

2)Queue -LinkedList internal datastructure is LinkedList

ArrayDeque VS LinkedList:
=========================

If you need add/remove of the both ends-
ArrayDeque is significantly better than a linked list. Random access each element is also O(1) for a cyclic queue.

The only better operation of a linked list is removing the current element during iteration.
